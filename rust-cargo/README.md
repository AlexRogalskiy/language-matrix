# Rust Programming Language

This project is _cargo_ based, which is the preferred build tool for rust. Like
other languages, this is test-centric. Find the test of what you're looking for.
and run the specific test using:

```shell script
cargo test --test variable-test
```

You can also run all the tests using

```shell script
cargo test
```

Rust was programmed using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs)
