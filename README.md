# Language Matrix

## What is it?
It is a project that contains (or should contain) the same samples per computer language topic across multiple languages. For example, if you look up a methods in Java, you should find the same examples in Groovy, LISP, C, C++, etc.  Any derivation from the primary examples will be presented with more clarity and explanation

## What will it not do?
It will not cover the multitude of libraries across different languages. This just focuses on the languages themselves and the capabilities they serve.

## How many languages are there?
Right now aiming for 10. This is a work in progress.

## How do I look up material?
Each language has a README.md, click on the language and view the topics.  Some topics will take you to the code directly, some will cross reference you to a topic. Say as a Java programmer you know what a List is, but when you look up Ruby and there are no lists, the Ruby README will cross reference you to arrays, which is how they create list like collections.

## Do you accept pull requests?
Absolutely. Be warned, I am aiming for a certain aesthetic and layout, so it may not happen right away.
